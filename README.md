## What is SmartLand?

SMARTLAND is an open source app for easy identification of vacant land in cities of Danube Region, its type and quality. Application itself consists of spatial datasets:

* [European Urban Atlas](http://land.copernicus.eu/ "European Urban Atlas")
* [CORINE Land cover](http://drdsi.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ "CORINE Land cover")
* [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/ "Mapbox | Design and publish beautiful maps")

## SmartLand users

SMARTLAND is a web application dedicated to food growers, city farmers and every person who is interested in the urban gardens and gardening in the cities. This application has brought huge added value for people who are looking for vacant land in cities of Danube region, in order to start any kind of agricultural activity (urban gardens, urban farms, community gardens).

## What are SmartLand benefits?

Users of SMARTLAND application can easily detect the vacant/unused land or urban area in their cities. Except the land use of the piece of land (which comes from the Urban Atlas dataset), user can also get the information about the land cover (this information comes from the Corine dataset). With combination of these information, user can consider, which piece of land would be the most suitable to meet the needs. The app might trigger the dialogue about the usage of land within local communities. Lastly, it is based on open data, free and open source technology.

## Who is involved in the Urban Atlas?

SmartLand was created and developed by a non-formal group of young coders and web developers and one devoted urban grower, who wanted to ease the process of food growing on urban areas. The first prototype was developed during DanubeHack 2016 where the group had first met. The development of the actual SmartLand application was subsequently funded by European Commission Joint Research Center (JRC) within the Danube Reference Data and Services (DRDSI) project.
